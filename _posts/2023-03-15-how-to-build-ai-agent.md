# How to Build Your First AI Agent with Python

AI agents are software programs designed to perform tasks autonomously based on predefined rules or learned behaviors. In this guide, you'll learn how to create a simple AI agent using Python.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* Python 3.8 or newer installed
* Basic knowledge of Python programming
* A code editor (like VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
* Understanding of basic AI concepts (helpful but not required)

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, let's create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir my-ai-agent
cd my-ai-agent

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install numpy openai gymnasium
```

## Step 2: Define Your Agent's Structure

Create a new Python file called `agent.py` with the following code:

```python
class AIAgent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.memory = []
        
    def observe(self, observation):
        """Process an observation from the environment"""
        print(f"{self.name} observes: {observation}")
        self.memory.append(observation)
        return observation
    
    def think(self, observation):
        """Make a decision based on observations"""
        # Simple logic for now
        return f"I've observed {observation} and I'm thinking about it."
    
    def act(self, decision):
        """Take action based on a decision"""
        print(f"{self.name} acts: {decision}")
        return decision
    
    def learn(self, observation, action, reward):
        """Learn from previous actions and their outcomes"""
        entry = {
            "observation": observation,
            "action": action,
            "reward": reward
        }
        self.memory.append(entry)
        print(f"{self.name} learned from action with reward: {reward}")
```

## Step 3: Create a Simple Environment

Create a file called `environment.py`:

```python
class SimpleEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "initial"
        self.steps = 0
        self.max_steps = 10
        
    def get_observation(self):
        """Return current state as observation"""
        return f"Environment is in state: {self.state} (step {self.steps}/{self.max_steps})"
    
    def take_action(self, action):
        """Process agent's action and return reward"""
        self.steps += 1
        
        # Simple logic for state transitions and rewards
        if "explore" in action.lower():
            self.state = "explored"
            reward = 1
        elif "wait" in action.lower():
            self.state = "waiting"
            reward = 0
        else:
            self.state = "unknown"
            reward = -1
            
        done = self.steps >= self.max_steps
        
        return reward, self.get_observation(), done
```

## Step 4: Create the Main Program

Now, create `main.py` to run your agent:

```python
from agent import AIAgent
from environment import SimpleEnvironment

def main():
    # Create agent and environment
    agent = AIAgent("MyFirstAgent")
    env = SimpleEnvironment()
    
    # Run a simple loop
    done = False
    total_reward = 0
    
    # Get initial observation
    observation = env.get_observation()
    
    while not done:
        # Agent observes environment
        processed_obs = agent.observe(observation)
        
        # Agent thinks and decides on action
        decision = agent.think(processed_obs)
        
        # Agent acts
        action = agent.act(decision)
        
        # Environment processes action
        reward, new_observation, done = env.take_action(action)
        
        # Agent learns from outcome
        agent.learn(observation, action, reward)
        
        # Update for next iteration
        observation = new_observation
        total_reward += reward
        
        print(f"Step completed, reward: {reward}, total: {total_reward}")
        print("-" * 50)
    
    print(f"Simulation complete. Total reward: {total_reward}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Step 5: Run Your AI Agent

Run your program from the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see output showing your agent making observations, thinking, acting, and learning from the environment.

## Expanding Your Agent

This is just a simple starting point. Here are ways to enhance your agent:

1. **Add Machine Learning**: Implement Q-learning or other reinforcement learning algorithms
2. **Improve Decision Making**: Use neural networks for more complex decision processes
3. **Connect to Real APIs**: Let your agent interact with real-world data
4. **Add Natural Language Processing**: Enable your agent to understand and generate text

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've built a simple AI agent that can observe its environment, make decisions, take actions, and learn from outcomes. This foundation can be expanded to create more sophisticated agents for various applications.
