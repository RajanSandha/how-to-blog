# Getting Started with Jekyll

Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator that makes blogging simple and straightforward. In this post, I'll walk you through the basics of setting up and using Jekyll for your blog.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes your content, written in Markdown, and transforms it into a static website that can be easily deployed to any web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can host your Jekyll site for free on GitHub.

## Why Use Jekyll?

There are several reasons to choose Jekyll for your blog:

- **Simplicity**: Jekyll sites are just static files - no database, no security vulnerabilities.
- **Speed**: Because Jekyll generates static files, your site loads very quickly.
- **Version Control**: Your entire blog can be version-controlled with Git.
- **Flexibility**: Jekyll is highly customizable with themes and plugins.
- **Free Hosting**: Jekyll sites can be hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

## Setting Up Jekyll

Here's a quick guide to setting up Jekyll:

```bash
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site
jekyll new my-blog

# Change into your new directory
cd my-blog

# Build the site and make it available on a local server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

After running these commands, your site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Writing Posts

Writing posts in Jekyll is easy. All you need to do is create a new file in the `_posts` directory with a filename in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Then, add the front matter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "My First Post"
date: 2023-07-15
categories: jekyll
---

Your content goes here. You can use **Markdown** formatting.
```
